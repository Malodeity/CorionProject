# PURPOSE: Analysis logic and reusable tools
# EXPECTED:
# - Strategy pattern for calculations
# - Average close + filter/sort helpers
# RULES:
# - Use list comprehensions and error handling (Unit 10)
# - Validate with regex (Unit 9)
# OUTCOME:
# - Abstraction and helper tools that plug into the flow

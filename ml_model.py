# PURPOSE: Machine Learning Logic Layer for Prediction
# EXPECTED:
# - Create, train, and use a regression model
# - Use sklearn for training and evaluation
# - Provide clean interface for model usage
# RULES:
# - Do not hardcode data paths or pipeline logic
# - Only define logic for training and inference
# - Keep class interface decoupled from I/O
# OUTCOME:
# - Understand ML abstraction via class-based design
